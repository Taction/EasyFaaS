# *_OUTPUT_ROOT    - the base of all output in that environment.
# *_OUTPUT_SUBPATH - location where golang stuff is built/cached.  Also
#                    persisted across docker runs with a volume mount.
# *_OUTPUT_BINPATH - location where final binaries are placed.  If the remote
#                    is really remote, this is the stuff that has to be copied
#                    back.
# OUT_DIR can come in from the Makefile, so honor it.
